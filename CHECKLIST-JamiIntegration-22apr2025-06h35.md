## Game Actions Implementation

### 6. Define Game Action Types
- [ ] Create interfaces for all game actions
  - [ ] Game setup actions (game_start, deal)
  - [ ] Core gameplay actions (draw, discard, claim, pass)
  - [ ] Special actions (kong_reveal, bonus_tile, game_end)
  - [ ] Add support for vector clock in action messages

### 7. Game State Management
- [ ] Create GameState class
  - [ ] Implement state update from game actions
  - [ ] Add validation rules for actions

  - [ ] Add UI for settings configuration

## Testing and Integration

### 10. Network Simulation
- [ ] Create NetworkSimulator for testing
  - [ ] Implement simulated nodes
  - [ ] Add message queue with delays
  - [ ] Add support for simulating disconnections
  - [ ] Add support for simulating packet loss

### 11. Integration Tests
- [ ] Create test scenarios
  - [ ] Test normal gameplay flow
